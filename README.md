# Ember Technical Challenge

Welcome to the Ember Technical Challenge! 

In this repo you'll find a simple app created with Create React App and an Express API with a single '/api/transactions' endpoint.

This endpoint returns a list of bank transaction objects that contain data we use internally at Ember. 

Your task is to create a single page that utilises the data provided by '/api/transactions' to show a list of these transactions and to allow these transactions to be filtered by their category. 

How you implement this filtering is up to you. 

### What we're looking for

Clean, easy to understand code.  
Clearly defined and separated components.
Communication throughout the call so we can get an idea of what it's like to work with you and point you in the right direction if you get stuck at any point.
